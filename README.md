# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier with FastAI

This project uses the FastAI library (built on PyTorch) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images of cats and dogs.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- FastAI
- PyTorch
- Google Colab (for GPU training)

## 📂 Dataset
Used the built-in ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func method from FastAI to load the Oxford Pets dataset.

## 📊 Results
- Achieved over 95% validation accuracy using ResNet34
- Implemented training, validation, and prediction on test images

## 👩‍💻 Author
Robiyaxon Otaboyeva

## 🧠 Future Work
- Experiment with different architectures (e.g. ResNet18, EfficientNet)
- Add Grad-CAM visualization
- Use custom dataset
